## Product Recommender System

We implemented two recommender systems for this project and evaluated the quality of the both systems. Our recommender systems used data that contained ratings of electronic products rated by users on Amazon. Our goal was to predict a rating for an item that an active user (a user that has given a rating for an item) has not rated yet then recommend a list of items in the database for the user. We first analyzed the given data with various plots for visualization. Then we implemented the item-based collaborative filtering recommender system and an advanced recommender system that used the alternating least squares method. In the end, we implemented an evaluation system to look at the precision of each system. The Python code is in the Jupyter Notebook file where the different components of the project are available in the cells followed by example outputs. Starting from task 2 and onwards the results that are discussed are for the first 5000 rows of the data, since the computation time for the whole dataset was not achievable with the resources that we had.
